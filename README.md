# PyMedia
My attempt to build a small media database to query and display media data

TODO:
- [x] Get media to scrape: videoLister.py
- [x] Scrape media data: scrapeOMDB.py / scrapeTVDB.py provides that functionality
- [ ] Build database: in progress, SQLite db, building data structures
- [ ] Display the media information: working on Flask based front-end to display media
available in db
